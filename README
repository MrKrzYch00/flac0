We are obviously assuming some things with this code here as it was never meant to cover all forms of operator's stupidity.
It was also never meant to be beautiful but of function, a kind of proof-of-concept on flac file size optimization.

Simply, put all bat files in some subdir of flac, including the flac file to process itself.
Run this script as so: script_name.bat "flacfile.flac" with CMD from that subdir.
.wav extension should work too.

It should fast check for best block size to use (88 attempts, 6 threads), parse that and run very slow flac encode with that block size.

In case it fails to reduce the size, this may be a sign that you may need varying block size, a sign that flacout will win this race.

After using flacout (if you decide to do so), make sure to copy tags with:
metaflac --no-utf8-convert --export-tags-to=- "origfile" | metaflac --remove-all-tags --dont-use-padding --import-tags-from=- "flacoutfile"
(if original has images inside, you may need to copy that too) then add seektable for the flacout's flac to be nice:
metaflac --add-seekpoint=10s flacoutfile
Edit the file with some tool like Xvi32 and alter the reference to be something like: "reference flacout block: vary"
so you know the file was parsed with flacout and the block size is not of fixed size.
Finally alter the date of the file manually if you want to keep the original file's date after processing.

WARNING! We are working with lax subset here, for storage and somewhat still-common-sense compatibility.
Use at your own risk, obviously. Edit to your liking.
